== Introduction

The flexy-pool library brings adaptability to a given Connection Pool, allowing it to resize on demand.
This is very handy since most connection pools offer a limited set of dynamic configuration strategies.

== Features 

* extensive connection pool support(Bitronix TM, C3PO, DBCP 1, DBCP 2, BoneCP, HikariCP)
* statistics support
** source connection acquiring time histogram
** total connection acquiring time histogram
** retries attempts histogram
** maximum CP size histogram
** connection request count histogram
** connection lease time histogram

== 1.0 TODO list

* make sure all metrics are closed on DataSource shutdown
* Sonar issues and test coverage
* write installation guide
* write user guide
* explain jmx metrics
* explain all configuration settings
* add real-life case study
